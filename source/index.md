# Introduction

Welcome to the Rocket API! You can use our API to access Rocket API endpoints, which can get information on various information about players and objects in Unturned.

The API is written in C# and only supports C#! You can view code examples for using the parts of the API in the dark area to the right.

This is bound to change as Rocket is a constant work in progress and this documentation may be outdated.

# Components
## RocketPlayerComponent
> To use, your class should inherit from this component

```csharp
public class PluginPlayer : RocketPlayerComponent {

	public bool HasKitten;
	
	public void Load() {
		this.HasKitten = true;
	}
	
	public void FixedUpdate() {
		if (this.Loaded && this.HasKitten) {
			RocketChatManager.Say(this.PlayerInstance, "You have a kitten!");
		}
	}
}
```

Applied to all players when they connect and removed when they disconnect (or plugin unloaded).

### Fields
Name | Type | Default
---------- | ---------- | ----------
PlayerInstance | RocketPlayer | Current RocketPlayer instance
